+.TH COROSYNC-KEYGEN 8 2010-05-30
+.SH NAME
+corosync-keygen \- Generate an authentication key for Corosync.
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B "corosync-keygen"
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+
+If you want to configure corosync to use cryptographic techniques to ensure authenticity
+.br
+and privacy of the messages, you will need to generate a private key.
+.PP
+.B corosync-keygen
+creates this key and writes it to /etc/corosync/authkey.
+.PP
+This private key must be copied to every processor in the cluster.  If the
+.br
+private key isn't the same for every node, those nodes with nonmatching private
+.br
+keys will not be able to join the same configuration.
+.PP
+Copy the key to some security transportable storage or use ssh to transmit the
+.br
+key from node to node.  Then install the key with the command:
+.PP
+unix#: install -D --group=0 --owner=0 --mode=0400 /path_to_authkey/authkey /etc/corosync/authkey
+.PP
+If a message "Invalid digest" appears from the corosync executive, the keys
+.br
+are not consistent between processors.
+.PP
+.B Note: corosync-keygen
+will ask for user input to assist in generating entropy.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP
+Generate the key.
+.PP
+$ corosync-keygen
+.br
+Corosync Cluster Engine Authentication key generator.
+.br
+Gathering 1024 bits for key from /dev/random.
+.br
+Press keys on your keyboard to generate entropy.
